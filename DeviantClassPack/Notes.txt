#Figure out how DoubleTap visualization stuff should work. - Not really priority

Figure out which stuff shouldn't work when suppressed
Add GTS stuff to my custom pack
Consider turning all of the overwrites in LW into their own skills so we don't have issues with other mods
Check the UI without the new screens and see if Brigadier rank shows up.  If not, try porting over LWPerkPack fix.
Looks like Conceal (also called Stealth in the code) has ini params from both LW and Vanilla to handle the same things.  Investigate this discrepancy.
Should add WotC considerations to LW perks:
  Template.SuperConcealmentLoss = class'X2AbilityTemplateManager'.default.SuperConcealmentStandardShotLoss;
  Template.ChosenActivationIncreasePerUse = class'X2AbilityTemplateManager'.default.StandardShotChosenActivationIncreasePerUse;
  Template.LostSpawnIncreasePerUse = class'X2AbilityTemplateManager'.default.StandardShotLostSpawnIncreasePerUse;

LWPerkPack port came out.  Work on making my mod independent.
Grab my own icons, or build with LW_PerkPack in the core stuff so I don't need it in my mod

Full Restore - Healing works, need to test against bleeding.  Also, stop cheating and get health to apply full heal.  Don't just apply a large number.
Resuscitate - Not targeting anything.
Ghost Protocol - Works, but threw an error and didn't visualize right.  Also, shouldn't target dudes who are just going to get revealed right away.
Repair Protocol - Spice it up a bit
