Figure out which stuff shouldn't work when suppressed
Add GTS stuff to my custom pack
Grab my own icons, or build with LW_PerkPack in the core stuff so I don't need it in my mod

# Development Suggestions
Use Event Listeners for Shield Mind and Feedback.  Use XMBEffect_ConditionalStatChange as a reference.
Full Restore and Resuscitate - Probably needs a custom targeting condition


# Noted Bugs
Full Restore - Healing works, need to test against bleeding.  Also, stop cheating and get health to apply full heal.  Don't just apply a large number.  Also, make restore action points conditional on some disabling status.
Resuscitate - Not targeting anything.
Ghost Protocol - Works, but threw an error and didn't visualize right.
Dismantle - Looks like it's destroying stuff, but not visualizing the destruction.
Whisper Strike - Still doesn't seem to work
Special Delivery - Does a lot of the visualizations, but still need to add World Effect stuff to gremlin visualizers.
Hell Raiser - Didn't trigger on killing civilians.  Probably going to have to do something about the cooldown on Remote Start.
Infuse Weapon - Not sure extra weapon damage is working
Backscatter Lens - Seems to work, but hard to tell if it's doing its thing.
Misdirect - Maybe call it a firecracker in the description.  Since it's exploding and all.
