TraverseFire - Not working
SaturationFire - Spread looks right from cannon, but doesn't destroy enough (a car seemed to light on fire).  Not sure if ammo cost works properly.  Shots from assault rifle doesn't look right.  Damage seems to work.
AreaSuppression - Having issues with animation from Assault Rifle.  Also seems to do a friendly fire thing.
