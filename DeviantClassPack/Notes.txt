#Figure out how DoubleTap visualization stuff should work. - Not really priority

Figure out which stuff shouldn't work when suppressed
Add GTS stuff to my custom pack
Setup boolean param to turn off/on changing of base game abilities
Rename stuff from LW_Overhaul so it doesn't overlap with other potential LW mods (consolidate abilities from LW_Overhaul)
Consider turning all of the overwrites in LW into their own skills so we don't have issues with other mods
Check the UI without the new screens and see if Brigadier rank shows up.  If not, try porting over LWPerkPack fix.
Looks like Conceal (also called Stealth in the code) has ini params from both LW and Vanilla to handle the same things.  Investigate this discrepancy.
Should add WotC considerations to LW perks:
  Template.SuperConcealmentLoss = class'X2AbilityTemplateManager'.default.SuperConcealmentStandardShotLoss;
  Template.ChosenActivationIncreasePerUse = class'X2AbilityTemplateManager'.default.StandardShotChosenActivationIncreasePerUse;
  Template.LostSpawnIncreasePerUse = class'X2AbilityTemplateManager'.default.StandardShotLostSpawnIncreasePerUse;

  LWPerkPack port came out.  Work on making my mod independent.

Smoke/PoisonEffect - LW had a bWorldSmokeShouldDisableExtraLOSCheck to ensure preview matched actual, but this hasn't carried through WotC or Highlander.  Maybe see if highlander can be updated with the params.

Full Restore - Not targeting anything.
Supercharge - Test against hacked MECs and Turrets
Resuscitate - Not targeting anything.
Boost Protocol - Targeting inanimate objects.
Ghost Protocol - Only targeting robots.  Works, but threw an error and didn't visualize right.
Burn Protocol - Targets MECs
Helping Hands - Cheat to gain extra point after expending during drop doesn't seem to work.  Also, gaining during pickup is probably broken (can pickup and drop all day long).  Maybe do mobility gain while holding instead.
